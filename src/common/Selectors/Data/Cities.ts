    Description:
      'Originally a nomadic people which generally consisted of Faeries, Fungril, Goblins, Orcs, Simiah, and Tethered, the Simyn roamed the “Barbaric Wastes” that now buffer Simyr and the Grafken Empire. However, upon discovery of a cluster of vIrstones, these nomads settled down and formed a small trading hub. Because of the proximity of the virstones, the growing population, and the increasing need for security and defense, the city of Simyr grew rapidly to encompass the surrounding virstones. Two centuries of successful, defensive warfare has seen the city-state blossom explosively, now spanning the entire isthmus it was originally settled on. This gives Simyr control of the easiest route from one sea to the other with two artificial canals connecting the great lake at its center.',

    Description:
      'This was once a small port city of native Prithans, a peaceful tribe who was no match for the raiding superiority of the proto-Grafken and were eliminated when the raiders decided to put down roots in their most recent conquest. Now, the capital of the Grafken Empire is its second largest city and sits along the bank of a large bay. On the opposite side of the bay, near the mouth, along the cliffs, is a virstone where a small outpost named Hawksmurth was founded to protect the artifact and has grown into a small town in peacetime.',

To the west lies the port city of Eelsmurth which acts as the primary source of egress between Nevin and Graf for both military and trade.',
