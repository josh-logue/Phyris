  'Grafken Empire': [
    "Bordered by Simyr to the south and the Quenn to the north, it's little surprise the Empire of Graf has been at the center of most martial combat in the last two centuries. A proud and warlike people, their Dwarf, Elf, Halfling, and Human ancestors sailed over from the Old World, raiding the coasts until finally settling in the port city of Graf. This came to be the seat of power for the fledgling kingdom and through domination of the western seaboard, soon became the center for trade along the western coast. Soon, expansionist plans saw them expand from one coast to the other, leaving vast swathes of corpses and barren land with small pockets of civilization interspersed within, usually within remnants of military outposts.",

  'The Golden City': [
    'Originally a nomadic people which generally consisted of Faeries, Fungril, Goblins, Orcs, Simiah, and Tethered, the Simyn roamed the “Barbaric Wastes” that now buffer Simyr and the Grafken Empire. However, upon discovery of a cluster of vIrstones, these nomads settled down and formed a small trading hub. Because of the proximity of the virstones, the growing population, and the increasing need for security and defense, the city of Simyr grew rapidly to encompass the surrounding virstones. Two centuries of successful, defensive warfare has seen the city-state blossom explosively, now spanning the entire isthmus it was originally settled on. This gives Simyr control of the easiest route from one sea to the other with two artificial canals connecting the great lake at its center.',

  'Quenn Chiefdom': [
    'The Quenn Chiefdom is a loose alliance of nomadic and pastoral tribes of northern Celasaan, “cooperatively” ruled by twin chiefs from twin cities Forth and Dirth. Although originally consisting of the Celassian ancestries native to that region, namely Firbolg, Giants, and Goblins, the Quenn, largely due to the unrestrictive nature of the collective, has more racial diversity than Grafken and Simyr. Adding to this, many members of both nations often immigrate north after feeling disillusioned with society or civilization. Because of this, there is little sense of national pride or organization, instead replaced by an unofficial sense of camaraderie and cohabitation through survival.',
  ],
  'Church of Daist': [
    "A religion originating from Dailands, the Church of Daist recognizes only the New God Daist as god, while other “New Gods” are pretenders and the Old Gods are nothing more than spirits or decrepit souls chained to d'Hahn. The presence of the Church on Celasaan is due to the efforts of pilgrims from Dailands who settled on the land that is now Termina long before the Grafken Empire reached that far east. In the modern era, the Church of Daist is the predominant religion of Celasaan led by the Dais Council, ruling body of the Church on Celasaan.",
  ],
  'Tairost Trade Guild': [
    "An international collection of traders, artisans, and guards, the Tairost Trade Guild is the predominant facilitator of trade between the various continents and subcontinents of d'Hahn. On Celasaan, they have offices in Nevin and Simyr and conduct most of their business on the segment from those locations. Each boasts a massive teleportation circle to enable the transport of goods in bulk.",
